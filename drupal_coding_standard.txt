Drupal follows PSR - 4 Coding standards.
Drupal 8 implements the PSR-4 standard and makes use of it to discover code, and to load the code on an as-needed basis 
rather requiring every single file in Drupal's code base to be loaded for every request.

AUTOLOAD:
PSR-4 is telling you how to create your file paths so that classes can be autoloaded.
This allow to create object without knowing the location of class file or its path.
